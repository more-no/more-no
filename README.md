### Hi there,  I'm Moreno 👋

<h3>A FullStack Web developer from Italy, living in Vienna</h3>

<h4>As a developer I love creating solid solutions with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js and PostgreSQL. Building Full-Stack applications with React, Next.js and REST APIs, I prioritize code quality through rigorous testing with Jest and Playwright. </h4>
<h4> My academic career took me to the highest levels of international research. Transitioned to the culinary world in luxury hotels and fine dining, I bring strong work ethic, collaborative spirit and a creative perspective to all I do. My background has equipped me with the ability to adapt to any challenge, organize effectively and think critically.</h4>
